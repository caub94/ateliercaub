                <p class="Text">My Name is Clara beckers and I am an architecture student at the TU Delft. This online portfolio aims to give an overview of my interests
                    and skill in architectural and other design, that I have either studied or that I am interested in. 
                    <br>One of my fascinations is simplicity of design and the mechanisms of knowledge, engineering, crafts and other metiers
                    working behind the screen of that simplicity. Similarly to that, this online portfolio shows only the tip of the iceberg
                    of my interests and skiil and I would love to share the rest with you. 
<!--                     My Name is Clara Beckers and I am currently studying architecture at the TU Delft. I grew up in Germany where I am originally from. I have developed a passion for moving to new foreign places from early not only while traveling but also in living internationally. I am not only excited about a broad range of experiences and knowledge concerning cultural aspects. My interests cover a wide range of disciplines from arts and crafts to engineering and digital technologies. I hope that you find these well represented in this digital portfolio. -->
